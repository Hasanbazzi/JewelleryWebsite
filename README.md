Jewelry E-Commerce Platform
This project is a responsive e-commerce platform for managing jewelry inventory and facilitating seamless online shopping. It demonstrates my skills in both front-end and back-end development using modern technologies.

Back-End Development
Implemented CRUD operations for the product model to manage jewelry inventory effectively.
Built RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and tested their functionality with Postman.
Front-End Development
Leveraged React Hooks to fetch and share jewelry information between components, such as the Checkout Page.
Used Props for component-to-component communication to maintain a clean and modular codebase.
Developed functionality to dynamically update the shopping basket whenever a user adds a new item.
Highlights
Responsive Design: Ensures optimal user experience across all devices.
State Management: Efficiently handled using the React Context API.
Collaboration: Focused on creating a maintainable and scalable codebase for future enhancements.
