### **Jewelry E-Commerce Platform**  

This project is a responsive e-commerce platform for managing jewelry inventory and facilitating seamless online shopping. It demonstrates my skills in both front-end and back-end development using modern technologies.  

#### **Back-End Development**  
- Implemented CRUD operations for the product model to manage jewelry inventory effectively.  
- Built RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and tested their functionality with Postman.  

#### **Front-End Development**  
- Leveraged **React Hooks** to fetch and share jewelry information between components, such as the Checkout Page.  
- Used **Props** for component-to-component communication to maintain a clean and modular codebase.  
- Developed functionality to dynamically update the shopping basket whenever a user adds a new item.  

#### **Highlights**  
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal user experience across all devices.  
- **State Management:** Efficiently handled using the React Context API.  
- **Collaboration:** Focused on creating a maintainable and scalable codebase for future enhancements.
